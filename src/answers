1. The constructor creates new objects with specific parameters
2. The advantages of Polymorphism is that code can be reused for different purposes, for example the wagons and engines have ids and weights
4. public void getNumberOfwagons(){
return mWagonCount;
}
5. public Wagon removeWagon(){
mWagonCount- -;
return mWagons[mWagonCount];
}
6. One advantage of using a standard library collection is that the programmer is able to reuse code without having to rewrite every algorithm out every time.
7. Programming in a team allows for greater efficiency and more ideas as well as second opinions which working alone does not have. Secondly, programming in a team needs to be more organized to ensure the final product works unlike working alone where you are the only person who needs to know how something works.

14. the Train class does not inherit from the RollingStock class because the method is called within the class.
